#Localization Remarks

- (The parse() method reads the values and converts it to Number if it succeeds. So, it does not use the maximum fraction digits set using setMaximumFractionDigits; however, if it were to use the format() method, which is meant for printing numbers, it will use this maximum fraction digits limit set.)
